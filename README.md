<h1>RyGuy's Discord4J Lib</h1>
Simple Library (kinda in awful shape rn) to help make working with Discord4J a little more convient and easier. To see an extremely general example of how to use this library, take a look here: https://github.com/TheRealRyGuy/Discord4JLib/tree/master/src/test/java/me/ryguy/testbot
